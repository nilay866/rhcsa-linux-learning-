# Day 1 – Linux Introduction

Today I started learning Linux for RHCSA.
My goal today was simple:
to understand what Linux is and use terminal without fear.

## What is Linux

Linux is an operating system.
It helps computer to work properly.

Linux does these things:
- Manages files
- Manages users
- Manages memory
- Runs programs

Linux is used in many places:
- Servers
- Cloud systems
- Android mobiles
- ATM machines

## Why Linux for RHCSA

RHCSA exam is fully practical.
We need to type commands and solve tasks.

There is no theory writing.
So daily command practice is important.

---

## Linux Distributions

Linux has different versions called distributions.

- RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)  
  RHCSA exam is based on this.

- Ubuntu  
  Easy for beginners and good for practice.

Most basic commands are same in both.

---

## Terminal

Terminal is used to give commands to Linux.
It is like talking directly to the system.

GUI is helpful,
but RHCSA needs terminal knowledge.

---

## First Commands I Learned

pwd  
Shows where I am currently.

Alternative:  
echo $PWD

---

ls  
Shows files and folders in current location.

Alternative:  
ls -l  
ls -a

---

cd foldername  
Go inside a folder.

Alternative:  
pushd foldername

---

cd ..  
Go one step back.

Alternative:

---

## Practice Done Today

1. Opened terminal
2. Checked current location using pwd
3. Listed files using ls
4. Moved inside folder using cd
5. Came back using cd ..
