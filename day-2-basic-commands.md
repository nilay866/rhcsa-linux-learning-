# Day 2 – Basic Linux Commands

Today I practiced basic navigation commands.
These commands help to move around in Linux.

---

## pwd command

pwd means "print working directory".

It shows where I am currently in the system.

Command:
pwd

Example:
If I am inside home folder,
it will show /home/username

Alternative:
echo $PWD

---

## ls command

ls shows files and folders in current directory.

Command:
ls

Common options:
ls -l   → shows detailed list
ls -a   → shows hidden files

Alternative:
dir

---

## cd command

cd is used to move between folders.

Go inside a folder:
cd Documents

Go back one step:
cd ..

Go to home directory:
cd

Alternative:
pushd foldername
popd

2. Listed files using ls
3. Went inside folder using cd
