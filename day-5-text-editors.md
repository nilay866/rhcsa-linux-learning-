vi file.txt

# vi editor modes:
# Normal mode  → default mode
# Insert mode  → press i to start typing
# Command mode → press Esc

# vi insert mode
# i  → insert before cursor
# a  → insert after cursor

# vi save and exit commands
# :w     → save file
# :q     → quit
# :wq    → save and quit
# :q!    → quit without saving

# vi navigation commands
# h → move left
# l → move right
# j → move down
# k → move up

# vi delete commands
