Day 3 – File and Directory Commands

Today I practiced basic file and directory related commands. These commands are used to create, view, copy, move, and delete files and folders in Linux.

mkdir command

mkdir is used to create a new directory.
Command: mkdir foldername
Example: mkdir test

touch command

touch is used to create an empty file.
Command: touch filename
Example: touch file.txt

ls command

ls is used to list files and directories.
Command: ls
Common options: ls -l → detailed list, ls -a → hidden files

cp command

cp is used to copy files.
Command: cp source destination
Example: cp file.txt backup.txt

mv command

mv is used to move or rename files.
Rename example: mv old.txt new.txt
Move example: mv file.txt Documents/

rm command

rm is used to delete a file.
Command: rm file.txt

rm -r command

rm -r is used to delete a directory with its contents.
Command: rm -r foldername

cat command

cat is used to display file content.
Command: cat file.txt

Practice Done Today

	1	Created directories using mkdir
	2	Created files using touch
	3	Listed files using ls
	4	Copied files using cp
	5	Moved and renamed files using mv
	6	Deleted files using rm
	7	Viewed file content using cat

Notes

File and directory commands are used daily in Linux. I will practice these commands again tomorrow.
